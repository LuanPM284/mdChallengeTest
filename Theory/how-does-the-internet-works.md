## How does the Internet work

A series of cables/wires, **not** a cloud

Wires allow communication
Server a special _computers_, with files inside

Ip addresses allow computers to find each other

> exe: 192.168.128.1

as "server" exemples:

- google.com
- facebook.com
- youtube.com

### Exemple

My computer at home is not a server because is not connected directly to the internet. It is a **client**, to an Internet Service Provider

My ISP will make the connection directly to the internet
Different servers will communicate in order to send a message from me to someone else, they allow the connection between people that have access to the same servers

The information is sent by packets

Routers and IP addresses allow to communicate with the appropriate devices
Routers will make sure the information is sent to the right device
